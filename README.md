# Unofficial Dynatrace Extension 2.0 to monitor APC UPS devices using SNMP protocol
## ⚠️ NOT MAINTAINED ⚠️ 

### Extension Framework 2.0

Extension written upon the [Dyantraceps SNMP Generic Device Extension 2.0](https://github.com/dynatrace-extensions/snmp.generic-device) where i fetch some more specifi information regarding APC UPS devices:
- Battery
- Input & Output (Voltage, Frequency, Phase ...)
- Status (Communication, Temperature ...)
- Generic Information (Nominal Voltage, Nominal capacity ...)

where you need to add the network, interface and traffic information based on the generic extension.

Used this oids as reference:
https://oidref.com/1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1

I personally suggest to eventually use this extension just for reference. 

⚠️ This extension was written for a test.

⚠️ **This is not a official Dyantrace Extension and will not maintained in the future.** ⚠️
